# RSA-Algorithm

In this project we Implemented different Types of RSA which include
  a) Original RSA Algorithm
  b) RSA-CRT Algorithm
  c) Multi-Prime Algorithm
  d) Multi-power Algorithm
  e) Rebalanced RSA Algorithm

We have implemented the algorithms in Java and vaiours comparisions were made wrt Decryption time VS Variants of RSA and Total Memory Consumed Vs Variants of RSA
