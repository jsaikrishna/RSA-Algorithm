# RSA-Algorithm

In this project we Implemented different Types of RSA which include
  a) Original RSA Algorithm
  b) RSA-CRT Algorithm
  c) Multi-Prime Algorithm
  d) Multi-power Algorithm
  e) Rebalanced RSA Algorithm

We have implemented the algorithms in Java and vaiours comparisions were made with respect to Decryption time VS Variants of RSA,Total Memory Consumed Vs Variants of RSA, Total time Vs Variants of RSA
